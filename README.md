# Forest Fire Dynamics in Alberta

This project delves into the dynamics of wildfires in Alberta from 2006 to 2023, analyzing key factors such as fuel types, weather conditions, fire frequency, and the causes of fires. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights that could inform emergency responses and monitoring strategies to mitigate the impact of future wildfires. Throughout the analysis, we utilized Python and various data visualization tools to generate meaningful insights.

The project begins with cleaning and preprocessing the data, addressing issues such as missing values and inconsistencies. Several techniques were employed to handle null values, including imputation and merging of columns, depending on the specific analysis required. Once the data was prepared, a variety of visualizations were created using Python libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. These visualizations provided insights into how different factors, such as fuel types, weather conditions, and fire causes, influenced the size and spread of wildfires. For example, scatter plots and line charts were used to analyze the correlation between temperature and fire size, while bar charts and box plots helped identify the leading causes of wildfires and the relationship between fuel types and fire intensity.

Through the analysis, we addressed four main guiding questions:

How does fuel type affect fire size and spread, and how does proximity to water sources influence fire severity?
How have weather conditions, such as temperature and humidity, impacted the frequency and size of wildfires?
Has the number and severity of wildfires increased between 2006 and 2023?
What are the leading causes of forest fires in Alberta, and are they more often caused by natural factors or human error?
The project uses Python not only to clean and transform the data but also to explore various visualizations that help answer these questions. By understanding the factors that contribute to wildfire behavior, the project aims to provide actionable insights for improving fire management and public health responses. This Jupyter notebook showcases a comprehensive workflow of data cleaning, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization, which serves as a foundation for understanding wildfire dynamics in Alberta and contributing to efforts to reduce their impacts.
